South Sudanese children have suffered from violence, displacement, lack of schooling, and forced recruitment into the army has taken a toll. Many orphan children trapped in the limbo of displaced camps within the country for several years where the future looks bleak. more than 1 million South Sudanese children are at risk of dying from hunger and curable communicable diseases. Due to the previous civil war, more than 1.2 million South Sudanese children need psychological assistance. Many of these children have been forcibly made orphans and have seen shocking brutality shootings and machete killings, gang rapes and sexual torture, assaults, and village burnings. The children in South Sudan, though formidable in their resilience, have now experienced war, witnessed violence, and have lost both parents.

Therefore, we invite you to join the ministry of supporting and raising these vulnerable orphans. As such, our collective responsibility is to change our planet for a better future for our kids.
